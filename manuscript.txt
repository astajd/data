ABSTRACT
Background
The primary histological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, which are the large aggregates of tau protein. Aging is the primary risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease, however, the underlying causes of tau protein aggregation and toxicity are unclear.
Aims 
Here we investigated tau aggregation and toxicity under the conditions of compromised protein homeostasis.
Methods
We used heterologous expression of human tau protein in the unicellular eukaryote yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with evolutionarily conserved protein quality control pathways and examined tau-dependent toxicity and aggregation using growth assays, fluorescence microscopy and a split luciferase-based reporter NanoBiT. 
Results
Tau protein expressed in yeast under mild proteotoxic stress, or in mutants with impaired pathways for proteotoxic stress response, did not lead to synthetic toxicity or the formation of obvious aggregates. Chronologically old cells also did not develop observable tau aggregates. Our examination of tau oligomerization in living cells using NanoBiT reporter suggests that tau does not form significant levels of oligomers under basal conditions or under mild proteotoxic stress. 
Conclusion 
Together our data suggest that human tau protein does not represent a major burden to the protein quality control system in yeast cells.

INTRODUCTION 
One of the most important neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of tau protein aggregates in the form of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons and glial cells.1 Affected brain areas progressively lose neurons, however the exact causes of tau protein aggregation and toxicity are unclear.2,3 Under physiological conditions, tau is a highly soluble microtubule-binding protein that is primarily located in axons.4 In AD, tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, dissociates from microtubules and accumulates in neuronal soma, where it forms paired helical filaments and further aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).1,5 In addition to losing its physiological function, pathologically altered tau exhibits a toxic gain-of-function, however the underlying pathways of neurotoxicity are not entirely clear. Although NFT are the most prominent neuropathological feature of AD, neurotoxicity is at least partially caused by tau oligomers and early-stage aggregates.6-8 Accordingly, tau oligomers were found elevated in post-mortem samples of AD brain.9 
Under normal circumstances, cells maintain protein homeostasis and prevent the accumulation of aberrant proteins by protein quality control system, a network of evolutionarily conserved pathways, including selective protein degradation by the proteasome.10,11 Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cell is a condition that represents a proteotoxic stress.12 Impaired selective protein degradation is one of the possible underlying causes of several neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein aggregation.13 Since the ability of the cell to maintain protein homeostasis decreases with aging14, impaired protein homeostasis is considered a possible factor in the development of tauopathies15,16. Furthermore, excessive amounts of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to ER-stress and activates pathways commonly referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR)17-19. Recent studies have indicated a connection between ER-stress and AD20-23.
To better understand the factors contributing to tau protein aggregation and toxicity, here we studied human tau protein expressed in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single cell eukaryote. Taking advantage of yeast as an organism suitable for genetic manipulations, earlier studies examined the impact of heterologous expression of human proteins associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases (such as amyloid-β24,25, α-synuclein26,27, huntigtin28 and c9orf7229,30 on yeast cell growth, and factors contributing to the toxicity of these proteins have been identified. Unlike the proteins above, tau has not been tested with a similar approach. Since there is no yeast ortholog of tau, and the human tau protein expressed in yeast does not bind microtubules31, yeast is a suitable model for investigating toxic gain-of-function. Tau aggregates present in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease are characterized by the insolubility in the detergent sarkosyl (reference Greenberg & Davis 1990). In the previous studies, yeast cells expressing human tau protein were biochemically analyzed for the protein solubility in sarkosyl, and a sarkosyl-insoluble tau fraction corresponding to around 0.02 % of total tau protein was detected in the wild-type strain (Vandebroek et al 2005; Vanhelmont et al 2010). In this study, our approach was to use two methods that allow monitoring tau protein in living cells, via fluorescent microscopy of tau fused to fluorescent proteins, and by a split luciferase assay.
Earlier studies indicated that tau protein expressed in yeast is not toxic under basal conditions31,32, however, it has not been known whether tau becomes toxic under the conditions of compromised protein homeostasis, such as when cells encounter an increased load of misfolded proteins, or in cells that are deficient in proteotoxic stress response. 
Many protein quality control pathways, including selective protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and some UPR pathways are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human33,34. Key components of the yeast UPR are Ire1, a sensor for unfolded proteins, and Hac1, a transcriptional factor that activates genes that suppress the consequences of proteotoxic stress35. In yeast, transcription factor Rpn4 plays a critical role in regulating proteasome levels by controlling the expression of genes involved in proteasome biogenesis and assembly. Under normal conditions, Rpn4 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, however, in response to stress that overloads the proteasome with degradation substrates, Rpn4 is stabilized and activates transcription of proteasomal genes, thus increasing the abundance of the proteasomes36. Mutants lacking Rpn4 exhibit lower levels of proteasomes under basal conditions, and an increased susceptibility to proteotoxic stress37. Together Rpn4- and Ire1/Hac1-dependent pathways represent two main proteotoxic stress response pathways in yeast38. 
Here, using heterologous expression in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we investigated human tau protein toxicity and aggregation under the conditions of compromised protein homeostasis and in mutants deficient in proteotoxic stress response. Our results indicate that mild proteotoxic stress does not promote toxicity and aggregation of tau in yeast cells. 


METHODS
Yeast growth media. Standard yeast media, such as liquid and solid yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium and ammonia-based synthetic complex dextrose (SCD) medium containing 2 % D-glucose were prepared as described12. Where indicated, 2 % galactose was used in SC medium. Cells were grown at 30 °C unless indicated otherwise.
Yeast strains. Yeast S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table 1. For details on yeast strain construction, see Supporting information. 
Plasmids. All plasmids are listed in Table 2. For details on plasmid construction, see Supporting information. 
Growth-based assay of cell viability. Cells were grown to the logarithmic growth phase and decimal dilutions of the culture were inoculated onto a solid medium, incubated at 30 C unless indicated otherwise and photographed after 3 days.
Microscopy. Cells were grown in SCD, fixed in 0.8 % formaldehyde for 10 min, centrifuged and washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the pellet was resuspended in PBS and suspension was dropped onto coverslips coated with concanavalin-A (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired using Olympus-BX53 microscope equipped with Olympus-DP74 digital camera and an Olympus 100×, oil-immersion 1.4 NA objective.
Luminescence measurements. Luminescence was measured in living cells grown in SCD using Glomax Explorer microplate reader (Promega) and NanoGlo luciferase assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase substrate NanoGlo was diluted 1:100 in dilution buffer and this solution was added to the cells in ratio 1:10. Bioluminescence arbitrary units were defined as the relative light units of 1 x 107 cells.
Immunoblotting analysis. Cells were grown in SC at 30°C, unless indicated otherwise, to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.8–1.0 and pelleted by centrifugation. Total protein was extracted as described previously39. Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 l distilled water, added 100 l 0.2 M NaOH, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, pelleted at 13000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 50 l sample buffer (0.06 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 5 % glycerol, 2 % SDS, 4 % -mercaptoethanol, 0.0025 % bromophenol-blue). Proteins were denatured at 95°C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed by antibodies: anti-tau (MA5-12808, RRID: AB_10980631, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1/1000), anti-V5 (RRID: AB_2556564, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1/5000), anti-HA (12CA5, Egon Ogris laboratory, Max Perutz Labs, Vienna, Austria, 1/1000), anti-Pgk1 (22C5, RRID: AB_2546088, Invitrogen, 1/20,000), HRP-anti-mouse (RRID: AB_330924, Cell Signaling Technology, 1/1000). Signal was detected and quantified by imager (ChemiDoc XRS+, BioRad Laboratories), and normalized to Pgk1 protein or to the total protein, using stain-free method (BioRad Laboratories).

RESULTS 
Human tau protein expression in yeast cells under the conditions of proteotoxic stress and in mutants compromised for proteotoxic stress response does not lead to toxicity 
To investigate tau-induced protein toxicity and aggregation in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the first step, human tau was placed under the control of inducible CUP1 and GAL1 gene promoters (Fig. 1 a) and the tau expression was induced by copper (II) sulfate and galactose, respectively. Immunoblot analysis showed protein bands of the appropriate size that were present only under inducing conditions, demonstrating the inducible expression of the tau protein in yeast (Fig.1 b and c). Next, we tested whether the expression of human tau protein in yeast cells leads to toxicity, by using a standard growth-based assay. The analysis showed that tau expression does not affect the viability of wild-type yeast cells (Fig. 1 d, e), which is in accordance with a previously published study that used constitutive tau expression from TPI1 promoter40. 
The expression of human tau protein in wild-type yeast cells grown under basal conditions did not result in toxicity (Fig. 1 d, e), however, it is possible that the protein quality control system in the wild-type cells compensates for the effects of tau protein accumulation, and that tau may be toxic under the conditions of compromised protein homeostasis. To test whether tau protein expression leads to a synthetic effect on cell viability when combined with the proteotoxic stress, we exposed cells to a mild heat stress of 37 °C, which leads to a higher burden of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates41. Induced tau protein expression did not affect cell growth at 37 °C, neither compared to cells grown at 30 °C nor to cells that did not express tau (Fig. 1 f). Next, we expressed tau in rpn4Δ deletion mutant that exhibits lower levels of proteasomes and an increased susceptibility to proteotoxic stress37. By comparing the growth of rpn4Δ mutant and wild-type cells expressing tau from galactose-inducible promoter we did not detect difference in cell viability (Fig. 1 g). Taken together, these results suggest that tau protein does not lead to synthetic toxicity in combination with a mild proteotoxic stress or downregulated proteasome levels.
When subject to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER (ER-stress), ire1Δ and hac1Δ deletion mutants with non-functional UPR exhibit a slower growth38,42-44. To test if the expression of tau protein in yeast cells results in ER-stress and UPR activation, ire1Δ and hac1Δ deletion mutants expressing tau from an inducible GAL-promoter were examined for growth. Compared to the wild type, UPR-mutants ire1Δ and hac1Δ expressing tau exhibited no growth delay (Fig.1 h, i), suggesting that expression of tau protein in yeast cells does not induce the UPR. The result is in concert with a previous study in which no evidence for the activation of UPR was found in a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant tau45, although UPR markers have been found increased in AD brains, in neurons with the diffuse accumulation of tau, suggesting that the UPR is involved in the early stages of tau pathology (reviewed in 23). 

Yeast cells under proteotoxic stress and during chronological aging do not form obvious aggregates of human tau protein 
To investigate the localization of human tau protein expressed in yeast cells by fluorescent microscopy, we genetically fused superfolder GFP (sfGFP) to the C-terminal end of tau and placed it under the control of a constitutive TEF1-promoter. Tau-sfGFP was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm of logarithmically growing wild-type yeast cells (Fig.2 a), which is in accordance with previous findings46 and indicates that tau in yeast cells does not form aggregates visible by fluorescent microscopy. Next, we investigated whether tau forms visible aggregates in cells subject to proteotoxic stress. To this end the localization of tau-sfGFP was analyzed in cells incubated at an elevated temperature of 37 C (Fig.2 b), in cells incubated with L-azetidine-carboxylic acid (L-AzC), a toxic analog of L-proline that leads to protein misfolding (Fig.2c), and in the rpn4Δ mutant with downregulated proteasomes (Fig.2d). Under those conditions, tau-sfGFP localization in the cytoplasm was diffuse, similar to that in wild-type yeast cells, indicating that proteotoxic stress does not result in the formation of visible tau aggregates. 
Age-dependent protein aggregation is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon associated with many neurodegenerative diseases47,48 therefore, we examined the influence of cellular aging on tau protein aggregation by expressing fluorescently labeled tau in yeast model of chronological aging. Cells were grown in liquid culture for several days without media change, resulting in the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state and chronological aging49. Yeast cell culture enters the stationary phase on the second day of growth on a synthetic medium50. In our experiments, tau protein localization was examined in three days old cell culture, which is an early phase of chronological aging. In approximately 10 % of the cells from the three-days old culture, tau-sfGFP formed punctate inclusions that were localized perinuclearly (Fig.2 e). To examine whether the observed tau-sfGFP aggregates form independently of the fluorescent reporter fusion, we constructed a fusion protein in which tau is tagged with a different fluorescent protein, NeonGreen, at the N-terminus. Cells expressing NeonGreen-tau fusion protein in three days old culture showed a diffuse localization and no inclusions were observed (Fig.2f). Therefore, the aggregates of tau-sfGFP that were observed in 10% of chronologically aged cells (Fig.2 e) were likely a consequence of the sfGFP, rather than the tau-aggregation. Together the results indicated that tau does not form visible aggregates in chronologically aged yeast cells, at least during the initial stages of chronological aging.

Luciferase-based tau-NanoBiT reporter for studying tau protein oligomerization in yeast
To study the factors involved in the tau protein oligomerization, we used a luminescent reporter based on the split luciferase, NanoBiT 51, and adapted it for the use in yeast (Fig.3.). In NanoBiT, luciferase NanoLuc is divided into a small (SmBiT) and a large subunit (LgBiT), that have very low affinity for each other, therefore their interaction, and thus the reconstitution of the luciferase, depends on the ability of the proteins fused with the subunits to interact. We genetically fused NanoLuc subunits to the C-terminal end of tau (Fig.3a). tau-SmBiT and tau-LgBiT were tagged with the epitope tags HA and V5, respectively, to facilitate distinction of the subunits on immunoblot. To reduce the likelihood that protein fusion will affect tau structure, a flexible Gly-Ser repeat was inserted between the epitope tags and the luciferase subunits (tau-HA-Gly-Ser-SmBiT and tau-V5-Gly-Ser-LgBiT). For simplicity, the constructs are referred to as tau-SmBiT and tau-LgBiT in the text. Each fusion was placed under the control of the constitutively active TDH3 gene promoter and the constructs were integrated into a common plasmid vector in antiparallel directions, to avoid sequence loss due to homologous recombination between the tau sequences. To ensure a moderate level of tau protein expression and thus reduce the likelihood of non-specific interactions between the subunits, constructs were placed on a centromeric (CEN) vector. Luminescence measurements showed that the luminescence of cells expressing individually only tau-SmBiT or only tau-LgBiT is negligible compared to cells expressing tau-NanoBiT, i.e. both constructs (Fig.3 c). Reporter activation was tested in cells expressing both constructs from the same plasmid (pKZ35) and in cells expressing the two constructs from the two separate plasmids (pKZ6 and pKZ7). Due to a higher level of reporter activation, and for simplicity, in further experiments that require the expression of tau-NanoBiT (i.e. the expression of both constructs, tau-LgBiT and tau-SmBiT) in the same cell, expression from the single plasmid pKZ35 was used.
To test whether the observed activation of the tau-NanoBiT reporter (Fig.3 c) is a result of the specific tau-tau interaction, or whether it represents a basal level of NanoBiT reporter activation due to the co-expression and co-localization of luciferase subunits, we compared luminescence of cells expressing both tau-LgBiT and tau-SmBiT (tau-NanoBiT) with luminescence of cells in which one luciferase subunit (SmBiT or LgBiT) was fused with tau, and the other subunit was fused to an unrelated protein that according to the literature is not likely to interact with tau protein. To this end SmBiT was fused with sfGFP tagged with the nuclear localization signal (SmBiT-HA-sfGFP-NLS) and co-expressed with tau-LgBiT (Fig.3d). As a second control for the specificity of tau-NanoBiT reporter activation, we co-expressed tau-SmBiT construct with the Tdh3-LgBiT construct that contains glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Tdh3 (Fig.3f). For each of the constructs above (Fig.3 d, f) we examined the protein expression using immunoblot. In cells co-expressing tau-LgBiT and SmBiT-sfGFP-NLS, luminescence was not significantly different than in cells expressing tau-NanoBiT (tau-LgBiT and tau-SmBiT) (Fig.3e). Likewise, in cells co-expressing tau-SmBiT and Tdh3-LgBiT, luminescence was similar as in cells expressing tau-NanoBiT (Fig.3g). The construct in which LgBiT was fused only with the V5 epitope (V5-LgBiT) was not expressed in the cells, or its level was too low to be detected by Western blotting (results not shown), therefore this construct could not be used as a control for the specificity of the activation of the NanoBiT reporter. 
In conclusion, bioluminescence in the wild-type yeast cells expressing tau-NanoBiT likely represents a basal level of reporter activation due to the co-expression and co-localization of luciferase subunits, suggesting that under the conditions tested, tau does not form oligomers in the wild-type yeast, or the levels of tau oligomers are very low. 
      
Mild proteotoxic stress and deficiency in Rpn4-dependent proteotoxic stress response do not induce activation of Tau-NanoBiT reporter in yeast cells
Impaired protein homeostasis and consequent proteotoxic stress are considered a possible cause of neurodegenerative diseases52. Therefore we examined the impact of proteotoxic stress on tau protein oligomerization by measuring tau-NanoBiT reporter activation. When proteotoxic stress was induced by incubating yeast cells at an elevated temperature of 37 ˚C for 30 minutes, there was no statistically significant increase in reporter activation compared to the cells incubated at 30 ˚C (Fig.4a). Next, we expressed tau-NanoBiT reporter in cells with RPN4 gene deletion (Fig.4b). We did not record a statistically significant increase in tau-NanoBiT in the rpn4 deletion mutant compared to the wild-type (Fig.4b). In conclusion, the results suggest that the conditions of mild proteotoxic stress and impaired Rpn4-dependent regulation of proteasome abundance do not induce tau protein oligomerization under the conditions tested in yeast cells. 


DISCUSSION 
One of the hallmarks of aging is a decline in protein homeostasis that manifests in accumulation of protein aggregates, suggesting that aged cells are not fully capable of controlling the accumulation of aberrant proteins. Compromised protein homeostasis, and a consequent proteotoxic stress, has been considered a possible cause of neurodegenerative diseases. 47,52 For instance, several studies have linked tau protein pathology to the UPS, although it remains unclear whether tau is the cause or a consequence of an impaired UPS.53-57 
Here we investigated how increased burden of misfolded proteins and mutations in the proteotoxic stress response pathways influence human tau protein when expressed in yeast. Earlier studies indicated that tau protein is not toxic for yeast cells under basal conditions31,32, however, it has not been known whether tau becomes toxic under the conditions of compromised protein homeostasis, such as when cells encounter an increased load of misfolded proteins. In previous research, tau protein toxicity in yeast was demonstrated only in two cases: in a strain with a mutation in ESS1, gene that codes for peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that is homologous to the enzyme Pin1 in mammalian cells46, and in yeast cells co-expressing α-synuclein32. 
Our approach was to simulate the conditions of proteostasis decline. First, we induced the accumulation of misfolded proteins by using a mild heat shock or growing cells in the presence of a toxic amino acid analog. Second, we disrupted proteotoxic stress response pathways mediated by Rpn4, the regulator of proteasome abundance, and by Ire1-Hac1-dependent UPR38. None of the tested conditions had an effect on the growth of tau-expressing cells. One possibility is that tau does not represent a substrate for the protein quality control system, that is, the cell does not recognize it as an aberrant protein. Alternatively, the tested conditions may represent a moderate stress that the cell successfully compensates for, or bypasses the impaired pathways with alternative mechanisms. In this case, the toxic phenotype may manifest under more severe stress, or in multiple mutants for different protein quality control pathways. Furthermore, a recent study has shown that expression of a cytoplasmic model misfolded protein NBD2* in rpn4 mutant did not lead to slower cell growth, while the expression of several membrane misfolded mutant proteins resulted in a slower growth of rpn4 mutant58. Based on that finding, it is possible that protein quality control mutants other than rpn4 may have a synthetic phenotype with human tau.  
Although NFT is the most prominent neuropathological feature of AD, it appears that the neurotoxicity is at least partially caused by tau oligomers and early-stage tau aggregates. 36-38 To be able to monitor tau protein oligomerization in living cells without the need for biochemical analyzes of cell lysates, we used a split luciferase reporter. Since a previously published study on HEK-293 cells showed oligomerization of tau that was C-terminally tagged with the Gaussia luciferase59, we designed tau-NanoBiT using tau C-terminal fusions with luciferase subunits. We observed that when both fusion proteins, tau-LgBiT and tau-SmBiT, were co-expressed in the same cells, their steady-state protein levels were uneven (Fig.3b). Taking into consideration that the bioluminescence intensity depends on the amount of reconstituted luciferase, the expression level of the fusion proteins in the samples that are compared has been taken into account when interpreting the results (Fig.3&4). Uneven levels of two heterologous proteins upon their co-expression in the same cells is not a phenomenon that is specific for tau-NanoBiT. For example, co-expression of tau with other proteins in yeast cells has previously been reported to lead to a lower tau expression.33 Furthermore, when using NanoBiT and in the study of Sod1 protein homodimerization in neurons, Oh‐hashi et al observed unequal expression levels of constructs despite the use of the same promoters in Sod1-LgBIT and Sod1-SmBiT fusions.60 Uneven expression of two heterologous proteins appears to be a common feature when using reporter proteins, not only in luciferase-based systems but also in fluorescent reporters.61 
In our experiments, activation of the NanoBiT reporter consisting of one luciferase subunit fused to tau and the other fused to a protein that is not predicted to interact with tau at a considerable level is likely due to a non-specific proximity of the luciferase subunits when co-expressed in the same cell. However, it has been previously shown that tau interacts with ribosomes in human tissue samples, and shows even stronger connections with ribosomes and ribosome-binding proteins in AD brain.62 Based on those findings, it is also possible that the activation of the control reporters is a result of tau proximity to unrelated proteins during their translation on the ribosome.63 Furthermore, although similar levels of tau oligomers have been reported in a split gaussia-luciferase assay when using N- and C-terminal fusions of tau to luciferase subunits, 59 it is conceivable that the addition of a NanoBiT subunit to the tau C-terminal end may interfere with the formation of tau oligomers. Additionally, tau oligomerization in yeast cells may require the use of seeds or aggregation-prone tau mutants. During the final preparation of this manuscript, a NanoBiT-tau sensor in mammalian cells that is based on N-terminal NanoBiT-tau fusions has been reported, which investigated full-length wild-type tau, disease-associated tauP301L mutant and the aggregation-prone K18 tau fragment with P301L mutation. 68 In that study, luminescence signal of cells expressing NanoBiT fused to wild-type tau decreased when cells were treated with a microtubule destabilizing agent, suggesting that this basal signal likely reflects molecular proximity of microtubule-bound tau, rather than the tau-oligomers. In contrast to wild-type tau, complementation of NanoBiT fused to the tau-P301L mutant or K18-P301L was less sensitive to the microtubule destabilizing agent, and the signal could be increased by the addition of seeds of recombinant tau or brain lysates from mouse model of tau pathology. 68 
Taken together, basal level of tau-NanoBiT signal detected in yeast cells in our study likely represents molecular proximity of luciferase subunits due to the protein co-expression. Future studies will test whether the yeast tau-NanoBiT can be activated above basal levels by using the seeds from recombinant tau or brain lysates, and will examine the effects of tau phosphorylation and aggregation-promoting tau mutations on the reporter activation. Moreover, it would be interesting to see whether proteotoxic stress would have an impact on tau oligomerization and aggregation under those conditions. 

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our results showing that human tau expressed in yeast under mild proteotoxic stress and in mutants with impaired proteotoxic stress response does not affect cell viability suggest that tau does not present a significant burden to yeast protein quality control system, or that other pathways are involved in mitigation of tau expression. The lack of obvious tau-aggregates and the lack of tau-NanoBiT reporter activation indicate that subjecting yeast cells to proteotoxic stress does not lead to tau oligomerization and aggregation. Protein homeostasis is maintained by an intricate network of pathways that in many cases overlap or complement each other, therefore tau aggregation and toxicity may arise upon downregulation of more than one pathway, in combination with a more severe stress, or upon addition of a tau seeding agent [64]. Future research using inducible tau expression and tau-tau interaction reporters in unbiased genetic screens may discover new factors affecting tau aggregation and toxicity.
