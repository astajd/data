ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: To analyse the relationship between sense of coherence and health amongst adolescents during secondary education.
METHODS: The longitudinal cohort study was conducted between 2016 and 2018 on a sample of 441, 15-year-old adolescents. 
RESULTS: Since the sense of coherence of the adolescents was very stable during the two-year period analysed in this study (129.85±21.55; 129.24±23.06) the theoretical assumption about its dynamics during the span of life is brought into question. The adolescents rated the physical health relatively high (73±6.93; 75.17±16.38) compared to the psychological aspects of their health (65.32±18.21; 64.88±20.80). Significant difference was found between adolescents with a low SOC and those with a high SOC in their physical (70.22 ± 16.62 vs. 76.65 ± 16.08) and psychological aspects of health (55.51 ± 22.17 vs. 67.86 ± 19.32). Moreover, having a higher SOC, being male in gender, and family status are found to be a positive predictor of mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: Sense of coherence has proven to be a significant and stable factor in achieving health, particularly its psychological aspects, whose implementation through salutogenic activities during adolescence requires improvement.

INTRODUCTION
Given that adolescence is a period of changes in every aspect of life, it implies many potential stressors, such as increased responsibility, school demands, and challenges in interpersonal relationships.1 Exposure to stressors, particularly school-related ones, negatively affects the health and quality of life (QoL) of adolescents.2 Numerous studies confirm the alarming share of mental functioning difficulties amongst young people, particularly the development of depression, anxiety, and risky behaviours.3 The approach of traditional research on various risks in adolescence has been increasingly shifting towards research of salutogenic factors, focusing directly on building adolescent strengths and opportunities, and aiming to promote positive outcomes and personal well-being.4,5 Instead of researching the origin and treatment of a given disease, salutogenic model searches for the origin of health, and for ways of preserving and improving it. According to salutogenesis, people are neither “sick” nor “healthy”; rather, health is defined as one’s level of life satisfaction and good functioning and is a dynamic process on a continuum between the two extremes of health and disease.6 To stay closer to the positive end of the continuum general resistance resources (GRRs) are important for an individual. GRRs are developed through educational processes and social roles, and their use in solving problems in adverse life events is made both possible and effective through one’s sense of coherence (SOC).
Aaron Antonovsky, the author of the theory of salutogenesis, defined SOC as a “general orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a predominant, enduring, yet dynamic sense of confidence so that stimuli from the internal and external environment are structured, predictable, and explainable; the strength needed to accomplish the requirements set by the stimulus available; and that these requirements are challenging, worth the investment and effort”.6 Being a life orientation of personal belief or view that an individual has about themselves and the world around them, SOC is the main concept of the salutogenic model supported by the argument that SOC is associated with both physical and psychological health.6 Thus, the way in which one perceives the world around oneself triggers the ability to manage tensions and stress. The course of the outcome of both stress and health depends on the strength of one’s sense of coherence.7 
The results of various studies have confirmed that there is a connection between SOC, mental health, and quality of life.8-12 However, only few studies in general and longitudinally designed ones in particular have addressed SOC in adolescents. Specifically, one systematic review describes the association between SOC in adolescents and their health. Studies have found that SOC in adolescents is related to health in terms of adolescents’ quality of life, health behaviours, mental health, and family relationships. Most of the authors suggest highlighting the need for more comparative and longitudinal research with a view to increasing our understanding of adolescents’ health in relation to SOC, and to developing services which would support both elements.10 
Life experiences during the school transition period are very intense. Adolescents move from a personalised school environment to a new, more demanding milieu. High school can affect students' health distinctly.13 They have to re-establish their identities and social connectedness within an enlarged heterogeneous network of non-familiar peers and multiple teachers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors that have a stimulating impact on maintaining and improving health and well-being to encourage adolescents in their strengthening and transition to adulthood.14,15 
Guided by the salutogenic model, we hypothesised that adolescents have varying sense of coherence during a two-year period. Also, we assumed that adolescents who have lower SOC will have poorer self-perceived health which is predicted by SOC during adolescence.
METHODS
Participants
This study adopted a longitudinal cohort study design. It was conducted in the period between October 2016 and November 2018 in seven high schools and six high school dormitories selected randomly from amongst the 15 high school dormitories and 55 high schools located in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. At the beginning of the 2016/2017 school year, in the selected high school dormitories there were 249 students who had enrolled in the first grade of high school. In the selected schools, there were ten homeroom classes comprising a total of 260 students. The response rate was 86% at the dormitories, and 89% at the schools. The study included 441 high school students who were, on average, 14.9 years old. Two measurements were conducted: at the beginning of secondary education, and during the third grade of high school which was the final grade for many students. The second measurement included 354 students, which is 80.3% of the initial sample. Table 1 shows a summary of the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants at the time of the second measurement.
Instruments
Sense of coherence scale (SOC-29), which represents an operationalisation of the theory of salutogenesis, was used to measure SOC. It is ranked on a 7-point Likert scale to measure self-perceived comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. The total score can range between 29 and 203 points. The higher the score, the higher the level of SOC. The reliability of the internal consistency of the SOC questionnaire ranges from 0.82 to 0.95.16 In our study, the reliability of the internal consistency of the questionnaire was measured at 0.87 in the initial study, and 0.89 in the follow-up study.
To measure the participants’ health status, the Croatian version of the SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire, licensed by the Andrija Štampar School of Public Health,17,18 was used. The questionnaire comprises eight dimensions: Physical Functioning (PF), Role-Physical (RF), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Social Functioning (SF), Role-Emotional (RE), Mental Health (MH), and Vitality (VT). For the SF-36 health status questionnaire Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient yielded 0.77 in both the initial and the follow-up measurement.
Procedure
The final participant sample consisted of all the students from randomly selected high school dormitories and high schools who voluntarily, and after all the information on the research was fully disclosed to them, agreed to participate in the research, and who did not satisfy any of the exclusion criteria, such as: parent/s being opposed to their child/children’s participation, significant personal traumatic event/s or physical illness, withdrawal from research at any time. High school dormitory respondents filled out the questionnaires during their study sessions within their study groups, and high school respondents filled them out during their classes. Respondent anonymity was guaranteed via a code that the respondents created themselves. 

Data analysis
The data were processed using the methods of descriptive and inferential statistics. A correlation analysis was conducted to determine the correlation between the measured variables, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to determine the reliability of the questionnaires, and regression analyses were performed to determine the significant predictors of the self-perceived health. The data was analysed using IBM’s Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 26.0. The statistical significance for all the tests was set at a p-value of <0.05.

RESULTS
The overall SOC scores at the beginning of secondary education ranged between 70 and 186; the mean score was 129.85 ± 21.55. The overall SOC scores at the end of secondary education ranged between 67 and 193; the mean score was 129.24 ± 23.06. No change in the average level of SOC during secondary education was observed. Meaningfulness was observed as the most pronounced component of SOC amongst adolescents (table 2).
Table 3 shows the differences in self-perceived health. No difference in either the physical or the psychological aspects of adolescent health during secondary education was noted. A comparison between the scores of the eight dimensions of health at the beginning and those at the end of secondary education shows that the PF and BP dimensions of health improved. The mean score for physical health was better than that for mental health. In the domains of mental health, VT and MH were given the lowest scores.
Table 4 shows the mean outcomes of the study. Adolescents with a low SOC assessed their overall physical and mental health as significantly worse than those with high SOC. Significant differences were observed across all the dimensions of mental health.
At the beginning of secondary education SOC was strongly correlated with the SF, MH, VT, and GH dimensions, and moderately correlated with the same dimensions at the end of secondary education (table 5). 
The final regression analysis identified the higher SOC components of comprehensibility [ᵝ = 0.21 (2.05, 8.42)] and manageability [ᵝ = 0.15 (0.67, 6.48)], maleness [ᵝ = -0.27 (-15.19, -7.18)], and an intact family structure [ᵝ = -0.14 (-12.66, -2.77)] as significant predictors of greater MH, accounting for 25% of the variance between expected and observed MH scores (Table 6). Furthermore, separate regression analyses for physical health were conducted, but proved to be a weak predictor of SOC. Only comprehensibility was identified as a significant predictor of greater physical health, accounting overall for 8% of the variance [ᵝ = 0.28 (3.56, 7.56)].
DISCUSSION
The mean score of 129.8 for the overall SOC at the beginning of secondary education and 129.2 at the end of secondary education shows relatively high average mean values which are in accordance with referral ranges.11 Therefore, SOC was stable during adolescence, thus refuted first hypothesis. Adolescents with a low SOC assessed their overall physical and mental health as significantly worse than those with a high SOC. Therefore, the higher SOC components, maleness and an intact family structure were significant predictors of greater MH, thus affirmed second hypothesis.
Our study found SOC to be very stable during secondary education. Although this finding does deviate from Antonovsky’s theoretical assumption that the formation of SOC is intensified during adolescence and stabilises around the age of 30,6 it is not the first study to establish that SOC stabilises much earlier. Honkinen et al.19 conducted the first prospective study to determine the stability of SOC in adolescents aged between 15 and 18 and found no significant changes in values between the first and last measurements, thus concluding that coherence stabilises before the age of 15. Also, Feldt et al.20 conducted a five-year follow-up study aiming to confirm the theoretical hypothesis that SOC stabilises only after the age of 30. However, the results showed that age played no role in the changes of one’s level of SOC. Based on the results presented in this paper, which are in line with the literature on SOC, revising the theoretical facts related to the development and stability of SOC in adolescence is required. 
If SOC is examined in terms of its components, meaningfulness reigns supreme. This is in accordance with the salutogenic model given that meaningfulness is the most crucial aspect of SOC as it reflects one’s motivation to deal with the stresses of everyday life12. The average values of all SOC components were high suggesting that the participants were, in general, equipped with the ability to cope with stressful situations. They, first and foremost, have the feeling that coping with stressful situations is worth the effort, that certain resources are available to them, and that everyday life situations leading to different tensions are generally explainable and mostly predictable. The data are supported by the results of the study conducted by Feldt et al.20 on a sample of older respondents, and by Barni & Danioni21 on a sample of adolescents. 
In our study, the results obtained for all the eight dimensions of health in adolescents were on average high, which agrees with the salutogenic theory. No statistically significant change in either the physical or psychological aspects of health was found when the results of the initial study conducted at the beginning of secondary education were compared with the follow-up study conducted two years later. The highest score was obtained in the dimension of physical health, while the lowest average scores were found in the VT dimension. Being a period of life between childhood and adulthood, adolescence belongs to the critical periods of life regarding the risk of developing MH issues, which is mostly contributed to by the school context, and family relationships22. Furthermore, these results are comparable to other studies in which young people achieved the lowest MH and VT scores23,24. 
Our study also found that the subjective self-assessment of adolescents with a low SOC of both their physical and psychological health is significantly lower, with significant differences present in all the dimensions of the psychological aspects of health. A systematic review of literature shows that adolescents with a lower SOC are more likely to be suffering from depression, anxiety, and psychosomatic problems. By contrast, adolescents with a higher SOC have a better quality of life, more positive health behaviours, play sports, use less medication, and avoid alcohol and cigarettes more often.25 In a study on a representative sample of Norwegian adolescents, Moksnes et al.26 also confirm the existence of a significant positive correlation between SOC and self-assessed health. 
In our study, a significant positive correlation between SOC and different dimensions of health was found. SOC significantly correlates with SF, MH, VT, RE, and GH. SOC correlates moderately with SF, VT, and GH both at the beginning of high school and two years into secondary education. Our study’s results suggest that there is a correlation between SOC and the psychological dimensions of health. However, the results do not show that there is a strong connection between SOC and physical health. This is both consistent with the literature27 and contrary to what Antonovsky predicted in his theory. 
In a study conducted in Japan to determine the link between one’s SOC and health status, Tsuno & Yamazaki28 also confirmed the existence of a significant correlation between mental health and SOC. According to these two authors, SOC is the main predictor of mental health. Moreover, their study also confirmed that the contribution of SOC to explaining one’s physical health is weak. In contrast, the regression model used in our study accounted for 25% of the observed variance in mental health using the predictors of SOC, maleness, and family status. A study on adolescents of an age group similar to the age group of the respondents partaking in our research was conducted by Moksnes & Espnes26, and their results confirmed that the contribution of SOC to explaining self-assessed mental health is both statistically significant and positive. Most studies do not mention gender differences in SOC in adolescents under the age of fifteen, while studies on older respondents witness higher SOC scores amongst males.29 As a result, gender is still an insufficiently researched factor in the context of SOC. It appears that gender may be significantly correlated with SOC, and that gender differences in SOC most likely result from biological differences determined by hormonal changes and psychological status.26 The importance of family status and family intactness has been described in other papers.30 According to the theoretical model, being more satisfied with family relationships, and the intactness of family in which divorce has not occurred contribute to adolescents perceiving tensions more meaningfully, and to parental help strengthening mastery and meaningfulness in adolescents. 
The results of our study contribute to the existing knowledge of SOC as a factor that influences adolescents’ health. Since our study was longitudinally designed, the value of its result pertains to the stability of SOC in adolescents during the period of secondary education, which is contrary to the theoretical assumption that it stabilises only at the age of approximately 30.
This study has several limitations. Firstly, the findings are based on self-reports and therefore subjected to a potential self-reporting bias. Accordingly, the procedure with strictly anonymous responses may compensate for such bias. Secondly, the follow-up period lasted only two years due to educational programs lasting three years at the secondary level. There is an intention to further monitor the respondents during the next periods of life, which include study, work and starting a family.
CONCLUSIONS
Adolescents with a low sense of coherence self-assess their physical functioning, general health, and all the mental health dimensions of their health as significantly lower than those with a higher sense of coherence. Furthermore, a significantly higher score given to the SOC components of comprehensibility and manageability by male respondents, and family intactness are predictors of mental health. It can be concluded that, within the high school context, improving health-promoting factors in general and SOC in particular is necessary so as to improve the mental health of adolescents with the help of the mechanisms of salutogenesis.
