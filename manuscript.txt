SUBMISSION TITLE:

Changes in sexually transmitted infections-related
sexual risk-taking among young Croatian adults:
Results from a 2005-2021 three-wave population-based
study
Abstract:
Aim To examine the prevalence and dynamics of risky sexual behaviors among emerging Croatian
adults in the 2005-2021 period. Method Three surveys were conducted on large-scale national
samples of young adults aged 18-24 in 2005 (N=1,092) and 18-25 in 2010 and 2021 (N=1,005 and
N=1,210, respectively). The 2005 and 2010 studies were conducted by face-to-face interviews on
stratified probabilistic samples. The 2021 study was conducted by computer-assisted webinterviewing on a quota-based random sample from the largest national online panel. Results
Compared to 2005 and 2010, the age at coital debut increased for both genders in 2021 (the median
by one year, to 18 years, and the mean by half a year, to 17.5 years in men and 17.9 in women). In
the 2005-2021 period, condom use increased by about 15% both at first intercourse (to 80%) and in
consistent use (to 40% in female and 50% in male participants). Controlling for basic sociodemographics, Cox and logistic regressions indicated that─for both genders─in 2005 and 2010,
compared to 2021, the risks/odds were significantly higher for reporting earlier sexual debut
(AHR=1.25-1.37), multiple sexual partners (AOR=1.62-3.31), and concurrent relationships
(AOR=3.36-4.64), while the odds were lower for condom use at first sexual intercourse
(AOR=0.24-0.46) and consistently (AOR=0.51-0.64). Conclusion Risky sexual behaviors decreased in
the 2021 survey compared to the previous two waves, in both genders. Nonetheless, sexual risktaking is still frequent among young Croatian adults. Introduction of sexuality education and other
national-level public health interventions to reduce sexual risk-taking thus remains a public health
imperative.

Method Three surveys were conducted on large-scale national samples of young adults aged

8

18-24 in 2005 (N=1,092) and 18-25 in 2010 and 2021 (N=1,005 and N=1,210, respectively).

The 2005 and 2010 studies were conducted by face-to-face interviews on stratified

10

probabilistic samples. The 2021 study was conducted by computer-assisted web-interviewing

11

on a quota-based random sample from the largest national online panel.

12

Results Compared to 2005 and 2010, the age at coital debut increased for both genders in

13

2021 (the median by one year, to 18 years, and the mean by half a year, to 17.5 years in men

14

and 17.9 in women). In the 2005-2021 period, condom use increased by about 15% both at

15

first intercourse (to 80%) and in consistent use (to 40% in female and 50% in male

16

participants). Controlling for basic socio-demographics, Cox and logistic regressions

17

indicated that─for both genders─in 2005 and 2010, compared to 2021, the risks/odds were

18

significantly higher for reporting earlier sexual debut (AHR=1.25-1.37), multiple sexual

19

partners (AOR=1.62-3.31), and concurrent relationships (AOR=3.36-4.64), while the odds

20

were lower for condom use at first sexual intercourse (AOR=0.24-0.46) and consistently

21

(AOR=0.51-0.64).

22

Conclusion Risky sexual behaviors decreased in the 2021 survey compared to the previous

23

two waves, in both genders. Nonetheless, sexual risk-taking is still frequent among young

24

Croatian adults. Introduction of sexuality education and other national-level public health

25

interventions to reduce sexual risk-taking thus remains a public health imperative.

Introduction

2

Sexual risk-taking refers to behaviors that can result in adverse effects on

3

reproductive, sexual, and psychological health, including sexually transmitted infections

4

(STI), sexual victimization, unwanted pregnancies, and reduced well-being. Risky sexual

5

behaviors typically include coital debut at early age, unprotected sexual activities, having

6

multiple sexual partners, and engaging in concurrent sexual relationships (1-3). Early sexual

7

debut and having multiple partners are consistently associated with unprotected sex and

8

increased risk of acquiring STI (4-7).

9

Globally, the highest age-specific prevalence of risky sexual behavior is found in

10

adolescents and emerging adults, with condomless sexual intercourse ranking second among

11

health-related mortality risks in young women and men (8). Transition to adulthood is a

12

period of intense exploration of sexuality, including experimenting with various sexual

13

practices and changing sexual partners (9). At the same time, young people often lack

14

knowledge of sexual health, emotional and cognitive skills necessary for responsible decision-

15

making, and communication competencies required for negotiating safe sex (9,10). The

16

patterns of sexual risk-taking acquired at young age continue to affect sexual behaviors in

17

later life, adding to cumulative risk of STI (11).

18

Recent international studies indicated that over the past 10-15 years sexual activity

19

and early sexual debut somewhat decreased among young people (12-19), albeit with

20

significant socio-cultural variations. Nonetheless, the prevalence of STI, unplanned

21

pregnancies, and abortions remained high or even increased among the youth

22

(5,10,12,13,17,20). In Europe, sexually active 15-24 year-olds bear the highest risk of

23

Chlamydia trachomatis infection, with nearly half of new cases being observed in that group

24

(21). Similarly, nearly 50% of all newly contracted common STI in the United States are

25

found among adolescents and young adults (22).

3

1

In Croatia, findings from a sole national repeated cross-sectional study on sexual

2

behavior among young people conducted in 2005 and 2010 revealed substantial and stable

3

levels of risky sexual behaviors (23-25). In particular, persistently low levels of consistent

4

condom use (about 30%) were observed, with one third of participants reporting delayed

5

condom application and one quarter concurrent sexual partners. At the same time, more than

6

80% of participants from both study waves believed that they were at low or no risk of

7

contracting STI. More recently, poor knowledge of risks to sexual and reproductive health

8

was reported among Croatian senior high school students (26), as well as high prevalence of

9

human papillomavirus among young women (27). This hardly comes as a surprise due to

10

absence of school-based sexual education in the country—which remains a highly politicized

11

issue—and the lack of organized national-level prevention efforts to reduce sexual risks (28-

12

30).

13

Systematic monitoring of sexual behavior in Croatian youth is a public health

14

imperative considering the levels of sexual risk-taking, prevalence of common STI, and

15

lacking education in responsible sexual behavior. This paper presents findings from the third

16

wave of the aforementioned national study on sexuality in young people in Croatia conducted

17

in 2021. The study aims to examine the current prevalence of risky sexual behaviors in

18

emerging adults and its dynamics over the 2005-2021 period with the purpose of informing

19

evidence-based national policy planning and public health interventions focused on young

20

people’s sexual and reproductive health.

21

Method

22

Sampling procedure

23

In 2005 and 2010, face-to-face surveys on sexuality-related knowledge, attitudes, and

24

behaviors were carried out in large-scale national probability-based samples of young adults

25

(24). Response rates were 79.5% in 2005 and 32.1% in 2010, with similar rates of non-

4

1

response due to the study topic (23.4% and 23.8%, respectively). Considerably lower

2

response rate in 2010 corresponds to a long-term negative trend in survey participation

3

(31,32). In 2021, the largest national commercial online panel was employed as the only

4

feasible solution for data collection during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

5

pandemic. Quota-based random sampling of the panel members was used with respect to

6

region, age (18-25 cohort), and gender. Applying post-hoc weighting for gender and age, the

7

sample is broadly representative of the emerging adult population in Croatia. Response rate in

8

the panel was 29%, with 84% of the responders completing the survey. Socio-demographic

9

structure of the three samples is presented in Table 1.

11

(TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE)
Participants

12

In 2005, the sample included 1,092 participants in the 18-24 age-range (Mage=21.0,

13

49.3% female). In 2010 and 2021, participants’ age ranged 18-25 years. 1,005 participants

14

were surveyed in 2010 (Mage=21.5, 49.3% female) and 1,210 in 2021 (Mage=21.7, 48.0%

15

female). The one-year difference in age ranges did not compromise between-study

16

comparisons. Just one of the 1,764 sexually active participants from the 2010 and 2021

17

samples reported having first sexual intercourse at the age of 25. Furthermore, 25 year-olds in

18

2010 and 2021 did not differ from their 24 year-old peers in the reported lifetime number of

19

sexual partners (χ22010=8.96, p=0.11; χ22021=6.94, p=0.23), number of partners in the past year

20

(χ22010=7.17, p=0.10; χ22021=0.98, p=0.81), condom use at first intercourse (χ22010=0.89,

21

p=0.35; χ22021=0.04, p=0.84), and consistent condom use in the past year (χ22010=5.01, p=0.08;

22

χ22021=1.04, p=0.59). Three participants from the 2021 sample who provided impossible

23

values (e.g. being 55 at coital debut) were excluded from the final sample (N2021=1,207).

24

Data collection

25

In 2005 and 2010 participants were interviewed in their homes. In 2021, computer-

5

1

assisted web-interviewing was used. Members of a commercial online panel were selected

2

randomly. Data collection took place from mid-November 2021 to early January 2022. The

3

Ethical Review Board of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of

4

Zagreb, approved all study procedures. All participants gave informed consent verbally or

5

electronically. The 2010 and 2021 surveys additionally included a biological component (not

6

reported here).

7

Questionnaire

8
9

An originally developed knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices questionnaire was
used. The first part (administered by face-to-face interviewing in 2005 and 2010) asked about

10

socio-demographic characteristics, HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes toward gendered sexual

11

roles, beliefs about condom use, and self-esteem. The rest was self-administered and focused

12

on sexual behaviors. The questionnaires consisted of 150-190 items and took 25-30 minutes

13

to complete. The original questionnaire was piloted among high-school and university

14

students. Instruments used for comparisons in this paper were identical in all study waves.

15

Measures

16

Age, parental education, family socio-economic status, type of the longest place of

17

residence, and frequency of attending religious services were assessed as socio-demographic

18

characteristics (for measure description see Table 1). Risky sexual behaviors were assessed

19

with the following one-item indicators: age at sexual debut (defined as first coital

20

intercourse), protection/contraception use at first sexual intercourse, condom use consistency

21

(past 12 months), number of sexual partners (“individuals you had vaginal intercourse with“)

22

over lifetime and during the last 12 months, and ever having concurrent sexual relationships.

23

An additional socio-sexual characteristic measured was gender of sexual partners (“persons

24

with whom you had oral, anal, or vaginal sex”).

25

Statistical analysis

6

1

Survival analysis was carried out to compare coital debut among study waves. The

2

probability of (not) having coitus before a certain age was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves.

3

Significance of between-study difference in sexual initiation was assessed by log-rank test.

4

Cox regression was used to address changes in sexual initiation controlling for basic socio-

5

demographic characteristics. To assess change over time in other core indicators of sexual

6

risk-taking (number of sexual partners in the past 12 months, condom use at first intercourse,

7

consistent condom use, and concurrent sexual relationships), multivariate binary logistic

8

regression analysis was employed with socio-demographics controlled for. All statistical

9

analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics v25 package. Probability value <0.05

10

was set as a threshold for statistical significance.

11

Results

12

Sexual experiences and behaviors over the 2005-2021 period

13

About 84% female and 88% male participants from the 2005 and 2010 samples had the

14

experience of sexual intercourse (Table 2). In 2021, the proportion decreased by almost 10%

15

in women and 20% in men. This change was reflected in the age at sexual debut. Compared to

16

earlier study waves, in 2021 the average age increased by about half a year, to 17.5 years

17

(standard deviation /SD/=2.3) in men (95% confidence interval /CI/=17.3-17.7) and 17.9

18

(SD=1.7) in women (95%CI=17.7-18.1). Similarly, median age at sexual debut increased

19

from 17 years (interquartile range /IQR/=16-18) for both genders in 2005 and 2010 to 18

20

years in 2021 (IQR=17-19 for women and 16-19 for men).

21
22

(TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE)
Kaplan-Meier’s estimation of the hazard function of sexual initiation also indicated an

23

increase in age at sexual debut (Figure 1). Log-rank testing confirmed that the change was

24

significant for both female (M(2)=41.68, p<0.001) and male participants (M(2)=34.94,

25

p<0.001).

7

1
2

(FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE)
Lifetime number of sexual partners was three or less for most young women across the

3

observed period (Table 2), with the median of two in 2005 and 2021 and three in 2010

4

(IQR=1-4). Change in the number of sexual partners was more pronounced in young men.

5

While considerable proportions of male participants in the 2005 and 2010 samples reported

6

more than five (around 30%) or even more than 10 (16.5-22%) lifetime sexual partners, the

7

majority of men in 2021 reported up to three partners. The proportion of those who had a

8

single lifetime partner more than doubled from about 15% in 2005 and 2010 to 33% in 2021.

9

Accordingly, median number of men’s sexual partners decreased from four in 2005 (IQR=2-

10

7) and five in 2010 (IQR=3-8) to three in 2021 (IQR=1-5). As for the past year, majority of

11

female participants (69-79%) reported a single partner. Among men, one sexual partner was

12

reported by majority of participants in all study waves as well, with this proportion increasing

13

from about 50% in 2005 and 2010 to 70% in 2021.

14

In all study waves, roughly twice as many men than women reported ever having

15

concurrent sexual partnerships (Table 2). However, the proportion of participants reporting

16

the experience decreased by the factor of three in 2021 compared to 2005 and 2010—in both

17

women (from about 17% to 5%) and men (from about 30% to 11%).

18

In 2021 condom use at first intercourse was reported by over 80% of female and male

19

participants (Table 2), an increase from the previous wave of about 12% in female and 15% in

20

male participants. Consistent condom use over the past 12 months among the sexually active

21

participants increased by 10-15% in 2021 compared to previous waves. Even with this

22

increase, less than 50% of male and 40% of female participants reported consistent use of

23

condoms in 2021.

24

Change in sexual risk-taking in the 2005-2021 period

25

Next, we tested for temporal changes in the select five indicators of sexual risk-taking

8

1

(age at coital debut, number of sexual partners in the past year, condom use at first vaginal

2

intercourse, consistent condom use over the past year, and concurrent sexual relationships)

3

while accounting for basic socio-demographic characteristics. Cox regression indicated that

4

the risk of reporting earlier sexual debut was significantly higher in men in 2005 and 2010

5

compared to 2021 (by 1.25-1.37 times, respectively), and in women by 1.27 times in 2010

6

compared to 2021 (Table 3).

7

(TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE)

8

Similarly, the odds of reporting any of the four remaining core indicators of sexual risk-

9

taking—controlling for socio-demographic characteristics—were lower in 2021 compared to

10

previous surveys, regardless of gender (Table 4). Female and male participants in 2005 and

11

2010 were 1.62-3.31 times more likely to report multiple sexual partners in the past year and

12

3.36-4.64 times more likely to report ever having concurrent sexual partners than in 2021.

13

Compared to 2021, in 2005 and 2010 both genders were less likely to report condom use at

14

first sexual intercourse (by 54-76%) and consistently over the past 12 months (by 36-49%).

15
16

(TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE)
Overall, the observed associations between study wave and sexual risks were moderate

17

in size in the case of concurrent sexual relationships, condom use at first intercourse, and

18

number of sexual partners in the past 12 months. In other instances, the effect was small (33).

19

Discussion

20

This paper aimed to examine the prevalence of risky sexual behavior in emerging

21

Croatian adults (early coital debut, multiple and concurrent sexual partners, non-use of

22

condom consistently and at first intercourse) over the 2005-2021 period. Previous comparison

23

of the 2005 and 2010 surveys pointed to stable and substantial levels of sexual risk-taking

24

(24). In the 2021 survey, nearly all core sexual risk indicators significantly decreased

9

1

compared to the 2005-2010 period. However, the prevalence of sexual risk-taking remains

2

substantial among young people in Croatia, particularly inconsistent condom use.

3

The observed change can be attributed to at least two sets of environmental and

4

cultural factors. The first one is related to the COVID-19 pandemic considering that the 2021

5

wave was conducted 20-22 months after its onset. As indicated by a number of international

6

studies (34-37), the imposed restrictions—as well as a spillover effect of sensitization to

7

health-related risks from the COVID-19 infection (35,38)—may have impacted sexual

8

behaviors measured in the retrospect of 12 months (fewer sexual partners, more consistent

9

condom use). Delayed coital debut and decreased number of sexual partners in younger

10

participants is also possible. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the change observed in this study

11

is predominantly associated with the pandemic. Most young people did not stop engaging in

12

sexual risk-taking during the pandemic (39-41), some even more intensely so to counter stress

13

and loneliness (42). Additionally, the Croatian government imposed a soft lockdown

14

following the initial two months of the pandemic (43), placing no limit on within-country

15

movement and social contact in small groups. In a national online survey of emerging

16

Croatian adults intimacy and sexuality during the COVID-19 pandemic, conducted 10 months

17

following its outbreak (44), only three percent of participants reported pandemic-related

18

separation from their partners. Additionally, an equal proportion of sexually active

19

participants (12%) reported having no sexual partners and having multiple sexual partners

20

during the pandemic. A lower frequency of condom use during the pandemic was reported by

21

16% of participants, while only eight percent reported an increased frequency of condom use.

22

To summarize, it appears that the pandemic affected sex lives of a minority of emerging

23

Croatian adults and did so inconsistently, contributing both to less and more sexual risk-

24

taking.

10

1

The second, socio-cultural set of factors therefore seems likelier to have influenced the

2

observed change in sexual risk-taking among emerging Croatian adults, particularly as recent

international studies carried out before the pandemic pointed to a declining trend in sexual

4

activity among younger cohorts in industrialized countries (12-19). Decreased sexual activity,

5

delayed coital debut, and lower number of sexual partners are attributed to several recent

6

developments. Ubiquitous social media use among young people (45,46) could be a partial

7

replacement or even a barrier for real-life sexual interactions given that online social

8

networking provides new forms of sexual expression (47), increases insecurity regarding

9

physical appearance and sexual performance (48,49), supplies entertainment that may

10

compete with sexual activity (15)—much like video streaming services and online sexual

11

contents (50)—and impedes development of face-to-face communication skills (51). Another

12

possible explanation is delayed transition to adulthood (50,52,53), which involves postponed

13

partnered cohabitation and prolonged co-residence with parents. This entails reduced

14

opportunities for sexual activity and persisting parental control over behaviors that often

15

contribute to sexual risk-taking, such as substance abuse. There is also increasing evidence

16

about the effectiveness of comprehensive school-based sex education, where available, in

17

promoting condom use, reducing risk of acquiring STI, and managing potentially harmful

18

effects of sexualized media (13,54-56). Finally, religiosity has been on the rise among young

19

people in the West over the past 15-20 years, the process partially influenced by neo-

20

conservative social and political movements (57). Although recent meta-analyses indicated

21

that religiosity provides limited protection against sexual risk-taking among young people

22

(58,59), intrinsic religiosity is increasing in Croatia (60) with the Catholic church and newly

23

established faith-based civic associations actively encouraging young people to practice and

24

advocate religious values (61,62).

1

The present study has several notable limitations. Firstly, health-related and social

2

context surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected sexual behavior of young

3

Croatian adults reported in the 2021 survey and reduced comparability with previous surveys.

4

As previously discussed, if present, this effect is unlikely to have substantially affected the

5

findings considering that the lockdown was mild in Croatia, with emerging adults reporting

6

either no effect of the pandemic on their sex lives or mixed outcomes (44). Secondly, the

7

2021 sampling and data collection approach diverged from the 2005 and 2010 studies, which

8

presents another potential obstacle to between-wave comparisons. The use of the national

9

online panel was driven by data collection feasibility during the ongoing pandemic, but also

10

by substantial and continued decrease in response rates observed in conventional field surveys

11

(63), particularly among young people (64). Large self-selection bias calls into question

12

probabilistic nature of conventional (probability-based) samples (65). Additionally, certain

13

drawbacks raised in the context of commercial online samples, such as that participants are

14

“professionalized”, were shown not to substantially affect data quality (66). Finally, the

15

validity of findings reported across the three surveys is limited by self-reporting, with some

16

indicators being additionally affected by recall bias. However, such bias is likely limited,

17

because our participants were in early stages of their sexual life and the retrospective

18

measures of sexual behavior were limited to the period of past 12 months. In spite of these

19

shortcomings, the three surveys remain the sole national-level research project in Croatia

20

aimed at monitoring and analyzing sexual behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs among emerging

21

adults.

22

In conclusion, sexual risk-taking is still relatively frequent among young people in

23

Croatia, but has substantially declined in the past decade. This positive change does not

24

appear to be driven by any systematic efforts to reduce sexual and reproductive health risks.

25

At national level, public health efforts to improve sexual and reproductive health in young

12

1

people remain sporadic and lacking in evidence about their efficacy. Due to political

2

controversies, comprehensive sexuality education is not included in the national educational

3

curriculum despite the fact that the majority of young people (67) and their parents (68) are in

4

favor of such addition. Continuous monitoring of sexual behaviors in young people therefore

5

remains a public health imperative, as do continued efforts in providing evidence-based

6

prevention, intervention, and education aimed to improve young people’s sexual and

7

reproductive health
